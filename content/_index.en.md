> **Reproducible Research** (**RR**) is the practice of distributing the publication of research together with data and software source code required to reproduce the outcomes discussed in the study. As such the research becomes alive as a whole reproducible research package describes not just the research and its results, but provides a complete laboratory in which the research can be reproduced, validated and extended.

> **R** together with **RStudio** is the best data science tool! It is open source and free software that is available to anyone with a desire to discover, learn, explore, experience, expand and share the algorithms of their data science journey.
