The instructor is **Dr Tatjana Kecojević** who is a longtime **R** user with a doctorate in Statistics from [the University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/). She spent many years working in the U.K. university sector as a senior lecturer and has published an extensive number of articles and papers in the field of quantile regression. Tatjana is the founder and co-organizer of [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org) Manchester, Belgrade and Novi Sad Chapters, leader of the [R Forwards](https://forwards.github.io) team and a Women in DS ([WiDS](https://www.widsconference.org)) ambassador. She is currently the founder and director of [SisterAnalyst.org](https://sisteranalyst.org), an organisation aiming to empower women from a diverse range of backgrounds through data literacy. Unsurprisingly, Tatjana is an enthusiastic R user and in addition to her involvement supporting women in STEM related activities, she is dedicated to creating an inclusive culture by developing initiatives supporting all underrepresented groups within the DS community.

>##### During my lecturing career I was incredibly fortunate to work with some truly amazing colleagues who helped me explore and develop my own teaching philosophy and practice. I gained valuable experience in developing, designing and teaching data analysis modules at varying levels of undergraduate and graduate courses. In particular I mastered my teaching skills by lecturing with George Rawlings and Ian McGowan on decision modelling modules. They taught me how to teach basic statistical concepts, which theoretically may be perceived as complex, in an effective way by emphasising concepts over formulae, engaging students to reason rather than to memorise.
